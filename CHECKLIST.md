# NetWatchM — Project Checklist

Last updated: 2026-02-23 (night)

## Completed
- [x] Core capture engine (tshark + async)
- [x] Threat scorer + detectors (port scan, brute force, exfiltration, new IP)
- [x] Whitelist checker (plain IPs + CIDR)
- [x] Alert handlers (terminal, logfile, sound, email)
- [x] Device inventory (store, resolver, exporter)
- [x] Terminal UI dashboard + inventory view
- [x] Systemd service (Linux) + Windows service stub
- [x] Connection report (HTML, CSV, table) — flows, protocols, domain/SNI
- [x] Investigate button in HTML report (modal + CLI command builder + context panel)
- [x] HTTPS on web server (mkcert for trusted cert; openssl self-signed fallback)
- [x] Metasploit investigate subcommand (`netwatchm investigate --target <ip>`)
- [x] arp-scan integration (cap_net_raw, no sudo needed)
- [x] Grafana Infinity dashboard
- [x] install.sh + install.bat (HTTPS cert setup via mkcert or openssl fallback)
- [x] 78 tests, all passing

## In Progress / Next Up
- [x] Demo report script with synthetic high/medium/low risk flows (`sudo bash scripts/run-demo.sh`)
- [x] gen-report.sh uses PYTHONPATH to guarantee local source (fixes modal disappearing)
- [ ] Auto-refresh the HTML report (serve live or add a refresh interval)
- [ ] Persist connection report history (timestamped archive in /var/lib/netwatchm/reports/)
- [ ] Alert on new/unknown devices detected by arp-scan
- [ ] Grafana dashboard panels for connection report data

## Known Issues / Notes
- `sudo uv` fails — always use full path: `sudo /home/jbaez120/.local/bin/uv`
- Regenerate report: `sudo bash scripts/gen-report.sh` (optional duration arg, default 30s)
- Demo report (synthetic high/medium/low risk flows): `sudo bash scripts/run-demo.sh`
- Report served at https://localhost:8765/connection-report.html from /var/lib/netwatchm/
- TLS cert generated via mkcert at /var/lib/netwatchm/server.crt (browser-trusted)
- Web server service: netwatchm-web (not netwatchm-server)
- Deploy server changes: `sudo cp netwatchm_server.py /usr/local/bin/netwatchm-server && sudo systemctl restart netwatchm-web`
- Live config: /etc/netwatchm/netwatchm.yaml — restart service after edits
- Email password: never in YAML, use NETWATCHM_EMAIL_PASSWORD env var
